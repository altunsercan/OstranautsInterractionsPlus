# OstranautsInterractionsPlus
Utility mod for adding new interaction actions in Ostranauts. 

## How to Install
1. Install UnityModManager (UMM) following the instructions here: [Installing UMM for Ostranauts](https://github.com/kubouch/OstranautsCsharpModdingQuickstart#part-1-installing-unity-mod-manager)
2. Download the InteractionsPlus from [releases page](https://github.com/altunsercan/OstranautsInterractionsPlus/releases), and extract the zip archive in Mods folder.
3. Start the game. If everything is configured correctly, a mod manager window (UMM) will appear at the start of the game. The window should list Interactions+ with a greeen light indicating successuful setup.

## What does this mod do?
Interactions+ is an utility mod that provides features for other mods to do. So it does not do anything by itself. Here are the current/planned features provided.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Custom `aLootItems` Actions |  Allows mapping C# methods to execute via `aLootItems` similar to how Ostranaut loot actions work. |
| Merging json Data <kbd>In Progress</kbd>| Searches data directory in other UMM mods and **logically** merge them on game's data handler. |
